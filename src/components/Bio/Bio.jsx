			{"Over the last few years, I've worked on a variety of projects in a variety of tech stacks. I've programmed semi-autonomous robots for human-robot teams with the ability to learn from colloquial speech, built web-scrapers, written REST APIs, built an iOS app, derived meaning from Twitter data, and much, much more. I like learning new things, so I try to take any chance I get to try out a new technology or jump into something I'm unfamiliar with."}

			{"Enough about school and work, I've got a life outside of all that, too. I live and breathe basketball and really think my hometown Phoenix Suns can be something great in a couple years. I also play basketball a few times a week, so if you don't know where I am, the local gym is your best bet to find me. I love travelling and learning about differet cultures around the world. I've also got a thing for learning foreign languages; I speak English, Hindi, some Japanese, and I'm working on French and Spanish. I want to be at a conversational level in all five of those by the time I'm 27."}
