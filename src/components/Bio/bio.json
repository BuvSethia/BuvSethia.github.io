    "Hello! I'm Sumbhav, a recent graduate from Arizona State University and Barrett, The Honors College (Class of 2016) with a B.S. in Computer Science. I'm currently a software engineer at American Express in Phoenix, Arizona.",
    "Over the last few years, I've gotten the opportunity to work on a variety of project in many different disciplines. I've programmed semi-autonomous robots for human-robot teams with the ability to learn from colloquial speech, built web-scrapers, written REST APIs, built an iOS app, derived meaning from Twitter data, and much, much more. I like learning new things, so I take any chance I get to try out a new technology or jump into something with which I'm unfamiliar.",
    "I do also have a life outside of all that, too. I live and breathe basketball and really think my hometown Phoenix Suns can be something great in a couple years. I also play basketball a few times a week, so if you don't know where I am, the local gym is your best bet to find me. I love travelling and learning about and experiencing different cultures. I've also got a thing for learning foreign languages; I speak English, Hindi, some Japanese, and I'm working on French and Spanish. I want to be at a conversational level in all five of those by the time I'm 27.",
    "Feel free to shoot me an email if you want to talk. You can also check me out on GitHub or LinkedIn."
